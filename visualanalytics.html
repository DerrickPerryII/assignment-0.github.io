		<h1> <u> Summary of the Visual Analytics Process </u> </h1>
		<p>The visual analytics process combines automatic and visual analysis methods with a tight coupling through
			human interaction in order to gain knowledge from data. Since data can be heterogeneous, the first step is
			to transform and preprocess the data before any analysis. Data cleaning, normalization, and grouping are
			common preprocessing techniques. After the transformation and preprocessing step, the analyst may choose
			between applying automatic or visual analysis methods. If an automated analysis is used first, data mining
			methods are applied to generate models of the original data. Once a model is created the analyst has to
			evaluate and refine the model, which can best be done by interacting with the data. Visualizations allow
			the analysts to interact with the automatic methods by modifying parameters or selecting other analysis
			algorithms. Model visualization can then be used to evaluate the findings of the generated mode. If visual
			data exploration is performed first, the user has to confirm the generated hypotheses by an automated
			analysis. User interaction with the visualization is needed to reveal insightful information, for instance,
			by zooming in on different data areas or by considering different visual views on the data. Findings in the
			visualizations can be used to steer with model building in the automatic analysis. Alternating between
			visual and automatic methods is characteristic for the visual analytics process and leads to a continuous
			refinement and verification of preliminary results.</p>
